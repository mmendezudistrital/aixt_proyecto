# Aixt's V language
**Aixt** _V_ language is based on [The V programming language](https://vlang.io/).

The _V_ grammar was taken from these sources (ordered by importance):
- Abstract Syntax Tree V's documentation: [https://modules.vlang.io/v.ast.html](https://modules.vlang.io/v.ast.html)
- _V_ grammar definition in Antlr-v4:     [https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/v/V.g4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/v/V.g4)
- _V_ grammar definition in lark:         [(https://github.com/Itay2805/Vork/blob/master/v.lark](https://github.com/Itay2805/Vork/blob/master/v.lark)

#  Diferences between Aixt's V and standard V
<!-- - **Aixt** supports the semicolon `;` by separating statements in the same line -->
- As _V_, **Aixt** support function attributes like `@[inline]`, but these attributes include others like `@[task]`  which gives support to multitasking in the transpiling to _NXC_ language and `@[as_macro]` for implementing them as C macro (low-memory devices).
- `mutex`  variables for giving support to multitasking in _NXC_ transcompiling

The main differences between **Aixt** and **V**are show as follows:

feature               | V                                 | Aixt's V
----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
strings               | dynamic-sized                     | fixed-sized and dynamic-sized if supported
arrays                | dynamic-sized                     | fixed-sized and dynamic-sized if supported
structs               | allow functions (object-oriented) | do not allow functions (only structured programming)
functions             | multiple return values            | only one return value
text macros           | not allowed                       | allowed by using '@[as_macro]' attribute, for functions and constants
`C` variables access  | not allowed                       | allowed by using 'C.var_name' syntax
global variables      | disabled by default               | enabled by default

#  Aixt's V language features
- All variables are local by default
- `__global`  keyword in case of needing global variables
- Integer literals in binary, octal, hexadecimal and decimal notation
- Floating point, `rune`, `string`  and _boolean_ literals
- Numeric literals can include `_`  for better readability
- Declaration of signed and unsigned 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit integer variables (also `isize` and `usize` )
- Declaration floating point variables of 32 and 64 bits including scientific notation
- Multiple declaration and assignment in a single line
- Declaration by default type inference for scalar and array variables
- Variable casting in case of need to specify the variable type of number of bits
- Function attributes using the syntax: 
  
``` v
@[attribute] 
fn <name>(<params>) {
    <statements>
}```

- Loops with `for` through arrays and integer ranges:

``` v
arr := [3,5,7,9]
for a in arr {
    a = 0
}
```    
``` v
for i in 1..11 {
    x += i
}
```
